Notes:
    -[x]Be sure to add check to custom colour schemes to not allow 'colour schemes' as a name.
    -[ ]Make multiple spaceship skins
    -[ ]Put spaceships on title screen that bounce off buttons and title
    -[x]Use class methods/variables to track location of all ships/wells?
        Means don't have to have a seperate variable to keep track of. Give each instance an id?
    -[ ]Check all naming conventions func: hello_world, class: HelloWorld, vars: hello_world
